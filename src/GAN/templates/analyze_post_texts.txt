I give you several posts of a user delimited by '<>' in addition to the user's bio delimited by '||'. Your task is to do the following:
1- Extract or guess the user's gender based on their posts or set it to NULL if you cannot find it.
2. Extract or guess the user's life stage based on their post captions as child, adolescent, young, or old.
3. Based on the language of the posts and the information in the posts, extract or generate the user's nationality and ethnicity.
4. Try to learn the user's point of view and generate a post that you think the user is likely to post.
5. Provide an explanation for how you reached the values for each of the fields.
DO NOT add any extra explanation to your response.
MAKE SURE the result is in proper JSON format like result={{ "gender": "gender", "life_stage": "life_stage", "nationality": "nationality", "ethnicity": "ethnicity", "personality": "personality", "explanation": "explanation" }}
The user's bio is:
{bio}
The user's captions are:
{post_texts_str}
